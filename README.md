<h2><center>Mini Project<center><h2>
Hi
This is a mini project I built for my AI for robotics course

This is an simple image classification model for celebrity images

The model I created has been trained 3 celebrity images with 100 images each
I have used SVM and RandomForest algorith to perform the training with 71% and 68% accuracy respectively

<h4>to run it on your personal system<h4>
Step 1: download all the files in this repo
Step 2: go to cmd and type pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: type juypter-notebook in the same directory as the files(assuming that jupyter notebook is already present)
Step 4: open Arjun_20243005.ipynb file in jupyter notebook and run all the cells
Step 5: You can input your own dataset by typing the name of celebrities in the cell that takes input and
downloads images from binge image downloader or you can directly paste ur labeled directory that has images of the celebrity in images folder
Step 6: run all the cells 

Accuracy metrics : 1) accuracy score 2)confusion matrix
